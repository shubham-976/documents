Got it! Here’s a refined list of dashboard ideas focused on metrics for general users and overall system performance, without individual user-specific data:

### **1. Snapshot Summary Metrics**
   - **Total Snapshots Executed**: Count of snapshots executed over various time periods (e.g., last hour, 24 hours, past week).
   - **Snapshot Types Distribution**: Categorize snapshot requests into types (e.g., Risk Calculation, Market Data) and show their frequency.
   - **Snapshot Success Rate**: Percentage of completed vs. failed snapshots over a selected time period.

### **2. Child Task Metrics**
   - **Total Child Tasks Created**: Aggregate count of child tasks generated by all snapshots.
   - **Task Status Overview**: Display total tasks by status (e.g., Running, Completed, Failed, Queued).
   - **Task Execution Time**: Average, minimum, and maximum execution times for child tasks, allowing trend analysis and bottleneck identification.

### **3. Resource Utilization Overview**
   - **CPU Utilization Metrics**: Overall CPU utilization trends during snapshot and task execution, including peak and average usage.
   - **Memory Usage Trends**: Graphical representation of memory consumption over time, identifying high-memory usage periods.
   - **Disk Space Utilization**: Trends in disk usage related to data processing, storage, and snapshots.
   - **Network Utilization**: Overview of network traffic used by snapshots and data exchanges.

### **4. System Performance Insights**
   - **Snapshot Latency Metrics**: Measure the average time between snapshot initiation and completion.
   - **Throughput Metrics**: Display the number of snapshots and tasks completed per unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily).
   - **System Load Overview**: Visualize average system load during peak and non-peak hours.

### **5. Historical and Comparative Analysis**
   - **Performance Trends**: Compare current snapshot performance metrics with historical data over days, weeks, or months.
   - **Resource Consumption Trends**: Show historical changes in CPU, memory, and network utilization.
   - **Snapshot Volume Trends**: Graph total snapshots run across different time intervals for a broad performance view.

### **6. Market Data Metrics (General Overview)**
   - **Market Data Load Times**: Track average data load times from various sources, indicating system efficiency.
   - **Data Updates and Integrity**: Count and trend analysis of key updates to market data that impact calculations.

### **7. Real-Time System Health Monitoring**
   - **System Health Overview**: Real-time dashboard panel for monitoring overall health metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage).
   - **Alerts for Resource Spikes**: Automated alerts for resource spikes, failures, or unusually slow task completions.

### **8. System Utilization and Load Distribution**
   - **Worker Node Utilization**: Show overall utilization of distributed worker nodes, helping to identify heavily loaded nodes.
   - **Task Distribution Metrics**: Display load balancing across worker nodes (e.g., number of tasks handled per node).

### **9. System-Wide Alerts and Notifications**
   - **Snapshot Failures**: Track and alert on snapshot or child task failures that affect overall system operations.
   - **Resource Thresholds Breached**: Notify when CPU, memory, or disk usage reaches critical levels.

### **10. User Activity Trends (General)**
   - **Overall User Sessions**: Display the number of active sessions and interactions with snapshots.
   - **Peak Activity Hours**: Identify timeframes with the highest snapshot and task creation activity.

### **11. Customizable Filtering and Views**
   - **Time-Based Filtering**: Provide options to filter data by specific time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
   - **Snapshot Type Filtering**: Allow users to view metrics for specific types of snapshots.
   - **Resource-Based Filters**: Offer views that focus on specific resource utilization like CPU or memory.

### **12. Data Export Capabilities**
   - **General Data Exports**: Allow data export of metrics for sharing and offline analysis, e.g., total tasks per period, average resource consumption trends.

Does this cover the general data points you need, or would you like to add any more general operational metrics?


Here's the detailed document for your FX Dashboard project, based on your requirements:

## **FX Dashboard Project Document**

### **1. Problem Statement**
The FX Vasara team processes millions of daily trades, calculating various risk parameters using market and trade data. This involves executing a large number of snapshots, which generate numerous child tasks and run on distributed worker nodes consuming significant memory, CPU, disk, and network resources. Monitoring, understanding, and optimizing this process is challenging, and users currently lack a centralized view of operational metrics such as snapshot counts, resource utilization, and system health. This makes it difficult to detect issues, predict resource bottlenecks, and analyze system performance over time.

### **2. Solution Overview**
The solution is to create a Splunk-based **FX Dashboard** that offers comprehensive visibility into snapshot and task operations, system resource usage, performance trends, and system health. The dashboard will display metrics relevant to general system performance and resource utilization, helping users identify issues, optimize workloads, and make data-driven decisions to enhance performance and efficiency. 

### **3. Current Status**
- **Initial Planning**: Requirements have been defined to create the FX Dashboard, focusing on general system metrics rather than individual user details.
- **Data Sources Identified**: The required data sources for the dashboard have been identified, including logs, resource monitoring systems, and task-tracking data.
- **Splunk Environment**: The Splunk environment has been set up, and initial data ingestion has been configured.
- **Basic Dashboard Components**: Initial work has started on creating basic dashboard elements, including snapshots run and child task counts.

### **4. Key Dashboard Features**
#### **4.1. Snapshot Metrics**
   - Total snapshots executed over configurable time intervals (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours).
   - Snapshot types distribution (e.g., Risk Calculations, Market Data).
   - Success vs. failure counts and rates for snapshots.

#### **4.2. Child Task Monitoring**
   - Total count of child tasks created.
   - Distribution of task statuses (e.g., Running, Completed, Failed).
   - Average, minimum, and maximum task execution times.

#### **4.3. System Resource Utilization**
   - CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization visualized through graphs.
   - Historical trends of resource usage.

#### **4.4. System Performance Metrics**
   - Snapshot latency (from request to completion).
   - Throughput metrics for tasks and snapshots.

#### **4.5. Real-Time System Health Monitoring**
   - Real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization metrics.
   - Alerts for resource utilization spikes, failures, and slow tasks.

#### **4.6. Historical Trends and Comparisons**
   - Historical data comparisons for snapshots, child tasks, and resource metrics.

### **5. Roadblockers**
- **Data Integration Challenges**: Some critical data sources may need additional integration efforts to be fully available in Splunk.
- **Performance Overhead Concerns**: Continuous monitoring may add overhead to system performance, necessitating careful resource usage.
- **Alert Fatigue**: Potential for excessive alerts if thresholds are not configured properly.
- **Granular Data Complexity**: Ensuring all data, especially historical and resource-specific metrics, are displayed correctly without overwhelming users.
- **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring accurate data representation through thorough testing, validation, and user feedback cycles.

### **6. Further Enhancements**
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use historical data to predict resource bottlenecks and task failures.
- **Resource Optimization Suggestions**: Provide actionable insights to optimize snapshot execution and resource usage.
- **Custom Alerts**: Allow customizable alert thresholds based on resource usage and snapshot metrics.
- **Interactive Filters**: More granular filtering capabilities, including custom timeframes and snapshot/task categories.
- **Integration with Other Dashboards**: Potentially integrate with other operational dashboards for a holistic view.
- **Documentation and Training**: Provide documentation and training for users to maximize the dashboard’s utility.
