To implement the behavior where each job runs **irrespective of whether the previous job finishes successfully or not**, with a 30-second delay between each, we can use the `sleep` command for the delay and omit any job dependencies based on the success/failure of previous jobs. Each job will start after a fixed delay (30 seconds), without waiting for the previous one to finish.

Here's the JIL code that achieves this:

### Systematic JIL Code (with 30-second delay between each job, regardless of job outcomes):

```jil
/* Definition of the Restart Box */
insert_job: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
job_type: b
owner: your_user_id
permission: gx,ge
description: "Box to restart VAS FX Snapshot services with 30-second delays between each job, regardless of job success or failure"
date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1

/* Job 1: Restart VAS_FX_Svc_SNAPSHOT_Pricer_prod */
insert_job: Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer
job_type: c
box_name: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
command: ser -d VAS_FX_Svc_SNAPSHOT_Pricer_prod
owner: your_user_id

description: "Stops VAS_FX_Svc_SNAPSHOT_Pricer_prod service"
date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1

/* Delay after Job 1 (30 seconds) */
insert_job: Delay_After_SNAPSHOT_Pricer
job_type: c
box_name: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
command: sleep 30
owner: your_user_id
permission: gx,ge

date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1
condition: d(Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer)  /* 'd' allows job to run regardless of success/failure */

/* Job 2: Restart 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_WorkerNode_prod */
insert_job: Restart_WorkerNode
job_type: c
box_name: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
command: ser -d 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_WorkerNode_prod
owner: your_user_id
permission: gx,ge
description: "Stops 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_WorkerNode_prod service"
date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1
condition: d(Delay_After_SNAPSHOT_Pricer)  /* 'd' allows job to run regardless of success/failure */

/* Delay after Job 2 (30 seconds) */
insert_job: Delay_After_WorkerNode
job_type: c
box_name: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
command: sleep 30
owner: your_user_id
permission: gx,ge
description: "30-second delay after Restart_WorkerNode"
date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1
condition: d(Restart_WorkerNode)  /* 'd' allows job to run regardless of success/failure */

/* Job 3: Restart 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_ID_Generator_prod */
insert_job: Restart_ID_Generator
job_type: c
box_name: 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
command: ser -d 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_ID_Generator_prod
owner: your_user_id
permission: gx,ge
description: "Stops 1VAS_FX_Svc_Snapshot_ID_Generator_prod service"
date_conditions: 0
alarm_if_fail: 1
condition: d(Delay_After_WorkerNode)  /* 'd' allows job to run regardless of success/failure */
```

### Explanation of Key Points:
1. **`condition: d(JobName)`**:
   - The `d` condition stands for **done**, which means the job will run **regardless** of whether the specified job (`JobName`) finishes successfully or fails. This ensures that each job runs without waiting for the success of the previous one.
   - For example:
     ```jil
     condition: d(Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer)
     ```
     This allows `Delay_After_SNAPSHOT_Pricer` to run **after `Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer` finishes**, irrespective of whether `Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer` succeeds or fails.

2. **30-Second Delays**:
   - After each job (e.g., `Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer`), a delay job (`Delay_After_SNAPSHOT_Pricer`) is added to wait for 30 seconds (`sleep 30`).
   - The next job will execute after the delay, irrespective of the previous job's success or failure.

3. **No Job Dependencies Based on Success**:
   - Using `d(JobName)` for each `condition` ensures that the jobs will run regardless of the success or failure of the previous job.

4. **Sequential Execution with Delays**:
   - Job 1 (`Restart_SNAPSHOT_Pricer`) starts first.
   - After Job 1 finishes (no matter the outcome), Job 2 (`Restart_WorkerNode`) starts after a 30-second delay.
   - After Job 2 finishes (no matter the outcome), Job 3 (`Restart_ID_Generator`) starts after another 30-second delay.

### How to Use:
1. Save the script in a file (e.g., `restart_box_with_delays_irrespective.jil`).
2. Load it into Autosys:
   ```bash
   jil < restart_box_with_delays_irrespective.jil
   ```
3. Verify the jobs and dependencies:
   ```bash
   autorep -J 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX -q
   ```
4. Test the box:
   ```bash
   sendevent -E FORCE_STARTJOB -J 1VAS_UAT_FX_Restart_BOX
   ```

This configuration ensures that each job starts after the previous one (or its delay) completes, irrespective of whether the previous job succeeded or failed, with a 30-second delay between each job. Let me know if you need any adjustments!
